# Crustal-Modeling
Includes models, scripts, and modules used for modeling ocean crust

This branch includes scripts used to analyze the isotropic and anisotropic properties of the oceanic crust; I used these for a research project. Included also are scripts used to plot data from what is outputted by their scripts. The original inputs are assuming they are being given tidal data outputted by "TAPPy", a tidal analysis package also on GitHub.

The scripts that run the models are titled "2D_model_10.version.py" for a given model and version/attempt at coding the model. These scripts ARE working versions, but they are not currently written to be incorporated into programs, or written with functions that can be used in other programs. They require a .input file; the structure and an example can be found in the beginning of each script's comments.
